# phpLynda

this is just a repo for my code that I will be using through Kevin Skoglunds lynda.com course, so I can commit to two different PC's easily

Notes on initialization:

1. Make repo, no readme file
2. `git init` under the root directory of the code
3. `git remote add origin https://github.com/AnacondaPython/phpLynda.git`
4. `git status` to check
5. `git push -A`
6. `git commit -m "First Commit message"`
7. `git push origin source`
